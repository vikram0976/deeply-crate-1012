                <p>Virat Kohli starts his T20 innings with a scoring rate 
                    a shade above the expected rate for the situation but then drops below average.
                     Liam Livingstone, by contrast, consistently scores above the expected rate through his innings

               <p>    "Other day in the nets, I don't know who was bowling to him - he faces the first two balls, and he says, 'That's ten off two.'"</p>
            <p>This was Kagiso Rabada describing his Punjab Kings team-mate Liam Livingstone in an interview after a match in this year's IPL. In the same chat, Livingstone himself outlined his T20 philosophy: "There is no time for blocks in T20 cricket." He walked the talk in his breakout IPL season with a strike rate of 176.3 in his first ten balls at the crease. This IPL, among the 66 batters who faced more than 60 balls in the first ten balls of their innings,
                 only Jitesh Sharma and Tim David scored faster.</p>
                 <p>Despite the apparent chasm between T20 and the two longer forms of international cricket in terms of risk-taking, data reveals that batters approach the beginning of their innings with circumspection and take time to "settle down", even in the shortest format. In Test cricket, the risk of a batter getting out increases sharply to a peak at about five runs, after which it slowly dwindles until the batter reaches about 25 runs - the classic "start". This pattern of hazard early in the innings is surprisingly common to T20 batting as well. More remarkably,
                     the peaking of the hazard happens regardless of which phase of the innings you start in.</p>
            <p>The plot below shows the "hazard function" - the relative rate of getting out after making some runs - for each phase of a T20 innings. The data is taken from more than 2500 high-level T20 matches since 2015, including T20Is, IPL, PSL, CPL, Big Bash and T20 Blast games. The curve for each phase - in a different colour - considers only the innings which start in that phase. For instance, the red curve only accounts for batters who have walked in to bat in the death overs.</p>
                    <p>There is remarkable similarity in the rise of the hazard function till about five runs, the initial phase when batters are vulnerable. After that, the hazard falls as a player gets "settled". The peaks of the curves are different in different phases, which marks the difference in the amount of risk-taking as an innings progresses, but the shapes of the different curves agree. "Getting your eye in" is a real effect, even in T20s and even in the slog </p>
         <h1>HAZARD IN T20 BATTING</h1>
            <img src="./Screenshot (128).png" alt="">
            <p>While this settling-in pattern is a consequence of how batting works, classical thinking about batting sometimes ascribes value to being set when it comes to hitting. There is a belief that being more set, i.e. spending more time at the crease enables the batter to hit better. This idea guides certain top-order batters - KL Rahul being perhaps the foremost example - in batting through the innings so they can hit at the death. The data, in fact, reveals that when it comes to hitting, there is limited utility in spending more time in the middle.</p>
          <h1>DISMISSALS PER BALL IN OVERS 17-20</h1>
          <img src="./Screenshot (127).png" alt="">
          <p>The data suggests that batters get "set" after about 15-20 balls in the middle. Their strike rate stabilises, reaching its cruising value. It turns out that this behaviour, which can be described as ramping up steadily to a final, stable strike rate, is universal across game situations. The next two charts illustrate the point. They show the average runs scored off a given ball in the batter's innings. A regression model - a mathematical predictor - was trained to predict this for each phase of the innings for different values of wickets lost in the innings. Information from 589,000 balls from the same set of high-level T20 games since 2015 as described above was used to inform this model.</p>
